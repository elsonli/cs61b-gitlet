# Gitlet

A project for Data Structures and Algorithms (CS61B), UC Berkeley's second introductory computer science course.

The project involves creating a version control system which mimicks some of the basic features of Git, as well as some additional features. The features implemented are `init`, `add`, `commit`, `rm`, `log`, `global-log`, `find`, `status`, `checkout`, `branch`, `rm-branch`, `reset`, and `merge`.
